# My First Project

# The Food DataBase

## "An app that walks you through preparation of indigenous recipes from over 30 countries"

### Website containing API used - https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

### Technologies Used - VSCode, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Ajax

# The Project

[x] Found an API that contains a list of recipes from 32 different countries

- Tested and confirmed that API works by inserting food name e.g. "Pasta" into value in link https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=Pasta

  -This API does not expand to dishes across Africa and the Carribbean. I want to change this. But for now, I'll work with what I have

[x] Created folders, boiler plates, and went "Live" via VSCode

[x] Created page text appearance in index.html file

[x] Defined constants in script.js file

[x] Pulled data from mealdb api using ajax and promises

[x] Rendered the function so it displays on webpage

[] Attempting to get a return message when user enters an item that does not exist in the api data and clear the page for the next input
